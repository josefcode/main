<!-- In this example, we used semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <section>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, and <ul> to provide meaningful structure and convey the purpose of each section. The developer's image is displayed using the <img> element with a descriptive alt attribute for accessibility. The CSS styles are added to enhance the layout and presentation of the page, making it responsive and visually appealing. -->
